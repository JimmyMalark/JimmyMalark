#  Hey! Iâ€™m Jimmy

Experienced web developer, designer and CTO. I specialize in designing and developing websites that are visually stunning and highly functional. With three years of dedicated study and hands-on experience, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and design skills to every project.
