Hello there! I'm an experienced web developer and designer, currently donning the hat of CTO. My passion lies in crafting websites that are not just visually stunning but also highly functionalâ€”an elegant dance between aesthetics and performance. 

With four years of immersive study and hands-on experience under my belt, I bring a delightful fusion of technical prowess and innovative design to every project I undertake. 

My coding journey began in the quiet corners of 2020, and I can confidently say itâ€™s been a thrilling ride ever since! ðŸš€ 

Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into the realms of data science and machine learning while passionately working on my startup. Join me on this exhilarating adventure as I explore the cutting-edge of technology and design!
